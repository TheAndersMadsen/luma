# GhostLock for Humane AI Pin

GhostLock for Humane AI Pin is an open-source, boot-scoped root proof of
concept for one exact retail firmware build. It exercises
[CVE-2026-43499](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-43499), a Linux
rtmutex use-after-free, from an ordinary authorized ADB shell.

The runner is deliberately narrow. It checks the complete firmware
fingerprint, kernel build, slot, shell UID and SELinux state before it stages
anything. A mismatch stops the run.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a kernel exploit. It can panic, reboot, or hard-hang the Pin. A hard
> hang may require unplugging the device and waiting for the battery to drain.
> Use it only on a Pin you own and can afford to recover. Root disappears on
> reboot.

Developer firmware, nearby firmware versions, and other Qualcomm `atoll`
products are rejected. See [compatibility details](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).
A matching Android fingerprint is not enough to bypass this check: A/B slots
can carry different boot images and kernel layouts under the same userspace
build identity.

Compatibility is defined by a versioned manifest under `profiles/`. The host
launcher, runner, generated native preflight, allocator geometry, minimal
symbols, and built payload are bound to that same manifest. Adding a slot to a
manifest still requires a clean-boot physical replay of the exact profiled
kernel Image.

The earlier slot-`_a` sequence completed the production-equivalent chain on
the second of two clean-boot attempts. Three later runs reset during its
credential transition. The current source repairs `init_cred` immediately
after each credential-pointer write, retains one same-PFN-proven reclaim page,
and gives every supervised route a distinct fake lock/waiter slot. That
sequence completed the full chain on slot `_b` in its first clean-boot physical
replay. Root remains boot-scoped; one successful replay is evidence for this
exact profile, not a reliability guarantee.

## Before you begin

You need:

- a user-owned Pin already authorized for ADB;
- a stable USB data connection and external power;
- `adb`, Python 3.10 or newer, `make`, and a C compiler;
- Android NDK `28.2.13676358` (r28c) to build the payload.

This repository does not contain an ADB private key, firmware image, boot
image, bugreport, device log, or prebuilt payload.

Install the pinned NDK with Android's command-line tools:

```sh
sdkmanager "ndk;28.2.13676358"
```

Confirm that ADB already sees the Pin as `device`:

```text
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
YOUR_SERIAL    device
```

## Run it

Clone the repository, then use the same explicit serial for every command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheAndersMadsen/humane-aipin-ghostlock.git
cd humane-aipin-ghostlock

./ghostlock check --serial YOUR_SERIAL
./ghostlock run --serial YOUR_SERIAL
./ghostlock verify --serial YOUR_SERIAL
```

`check` is read-only. It prints the detected firmware, kernel, slot, shell
boundary, SELinux state, battery, power source, NDK revision, and build-tool
status. Its diagnostic output masks the device serial by default.

`run` performs one guarded attempt. It asks you to type
`ROOT YOUR_SERIAL`, builds from source, verifies the payload hash after
pushing it, captures a current-boot bugreport to derive KASLR, deletes that raw
bugreport by default, and starts the exploit only after a second complete
preflight. The launcher requires at least 20% battery and external power by
default, then the runner rechecks both immediately before it consumes the
boot's single attempt. `--min-battery 0` disables both power gates and is
intended only when stable power has been confirmed independently.

`verify` independently asks the boot-scoped root broker to run `id` and
`getenforce`.

A successful verification looks like this:

```text
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=u:r:kernel:s0
SELinux: Permissive
Boot epoch: <redacted>; uptime: <redacted>s
```

The exact SELinux context is kernel and firmware specific. The acceptance
condition is UID/GID 0 through the broker with SELinux permissive on the same
boot.

## What the PoC changes

For the current boot, the payload:

1. replaces the exploit process's credential pointers with `init_cred`;
2. clears SELinux enforcing and reloads the current policy;
3. writes a small command client to `/data/local/tmp/su`;
4. starts a Unix-socket broker that accepts only kernel-authenticated UID 0 or
   Android shell UID 2000 peers.

It does not write a partition, unlock the bootloader, install a module, modify
verified boot, create reboot persistence, contact a network service, or upload
telemetry.

Run a root command from another ADB shell with:

```sh
adb -s YOUR_SERIAL shell '/data/local/tmp/su -c id'
```

## Failure and recovery

The runner permits one attempt per kernel boot. If it reports a miss, timeout,
disconnect, uncertain state, panic, or reboot, do not retry on that boot.
Reboot first and run `check` again.

If ADB still responds:

```sh
adb -s YOUR_SERIAL reboot
```

If the Pin is hard-hung and ADB does not respond, disconnect all external
power. The tested retail hardware has no dependable user-accessible forced
restart, so recovery may require waiting for the battery to drain before
reconnecting power.

After a normal reboot, root is gone. The staged files may remain inert under
`/data/local/tmp`; a clean shell can remove them, including the boot-specific
atomic attempt claims:

```sh
adb -s YOUR_SERIAL shell 'rm -f /data/local/tmp/ghostlock-aipin.so /data/local/tmp/su /data/local/tmp/.ghostlock-su.sock /data/local/tmp/.ghostlock-aipin-attempt'
adb -s YOUR_SERIAL shell 'rm -rf /data/local/tmp/.ghostlock-aipin-attempt.*.lock'
```

Read [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) before using the PoC and
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) before retrying a failed run.

## Private logs and issue reports

Run records are written to a mode-0700 temporary directory. They contain a
device serial, boot identity, kernel addresses, and exploit telemetry. Never
attach that directory or a raw Android bugreport to an issue.

Create a reduced report instead:

```sh
./ghostlock report /tmp/ghostlock-aipin-TIMESTAMP --output ghostlock-report.json
```

Review the JSON before sharing it. The redactor omits serials, boot IDs, host
paths, raw command output, and kernel addresses. It includes fixed monotonic
durations for the preflight, exploit, verification, and total run so failures
can be compared without sharing device evidence. See
[PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md).

## Build and test

Build the Android payload:

```sh
./ghostlock build
```

When more than one evidence-backed profile exists, select one explicitly:

```sh
./ghostlock build --profile humane-aipin-45.20-nov4
```

Run all host tests and two independent builds:

```sh
./scripts/verify-release.sh
```

The payload is written to:

```text
source/build/humane-aipin-45.20/bin/preload.so
```

Build products are ignored by Git. Release assets should be verified against
the checksums attached to the corresponding GitHub release.

## How it works

The exploit uses the CVE's dangling stack-resident `rt_mutex_waiter` to
route a controlled red-black-tree update. KernelSnitch first leaks an
`mm_struct` address through futex-hash timing. A same-PFN perf-event gate
then proves that the released order-3 slab page was reclaimed by controlled
socket-buffer data before the corruption trigger can proceed. A boot-bound
KASLR base is derived from at least two agreeing current-boot WARN anchors.
The production payload validates that supplied base and goes directly to the
read/write route, avoiding a redundant destructive slide-oracle trigger. The
route resolves the current task and performs the boot-scoped credential
change.

The target profile contains only the offsets and symbols consumed by this
route. The kernel Image and full symbol table are not distributed.
[TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md) describes the stages and fail-closed gates.
