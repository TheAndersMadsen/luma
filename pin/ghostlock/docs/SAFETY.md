# Safety model

GhostLock crosses a kernel privilege boundary and deliberately exercises a
use-after-free. A correct target profile reduces uncertainty; it does not make
kernel memory corruption safe.

## Before a run

Use a device you own. Back up any data you can access, close unrelated ADB
sessions, connect stable external power, and keep the USB data path physically
stable. Run `./ghostlock check --serial YOUR_SERIAL` immediately before the
attempt.

The check must show:

- the exact supported fingerprint, kernel version, and machine;
- slot `_a` or `_b`;
- UID 2000 in `u:r:shell:s0`;
- SELinux `Enforcing`;
- an authorized ADB state;
- known battery state and connected external power.

Do not override a failed target gate. A nearby firmware can move every kernel
offset while retaining the same Android and kernel version strings.

## One attempt per boot

Immediately before writing the boot-bound marker, the runner rechecks battery
level and external power using the launcher's `--min-battery` threshold. An
unavailable reading, a low level, or disconnected power stops the run without
consuming the attempt. A threshold of zero explicitly disables this power
gate. The runner then atomically creates a boot-specific claim directory, so
concurrent runners cannot both enter the corruption stage. It never removes a
stale claim while a run is in progress. After the claim is acquired, a second
attempt on the same boot is rejected. Reboot after any failure, disconnect,
timeout, or result you cannot explain.

The direct stage additionally requires performance CPU 7. The boot runner's
UID-1000 broker moves only the exact Binder-calling Shell process to Android's
restricted process group, the reviewed 0-7 cpuset on this firmware, and
verifies CPU 7 there. The native payload verifies and pins CPU 7 again before
it reclaims a kernel page. Failure at either check stops before the direct
reclaim.

This rule matters because a failed route may leave allocator or rtmutex state
changed even when user space still appears healthy.

## Hard-hang recovery

A hard hang can stop ADB and the normal reboot path. If this happens:

1. stop issuing ADB commands;
2. disconnect USB and every charger;
3. wait for the internal battery to drain;
4. reconnect power and wait for a normal boot;
5. run `check` again before deciding whether to retry.

The tested retail hardware has no dependable user-accessible forced-restart
combination. Do not improvise with EDL writes, partition flashing, or voltage
injection as part of this PoC.

## Changes made by the PoC

The payload changes credentials and SELinux state in RAM, stages files under
`/data/local/tmp`, and starts a local Unix-socket command broker. It performs
no partition writes and installs no boot persistence.

A reboot is the security boundary that removes live root. Staged files may
remain as inert data until removed by the cleanup command in the README.

## Stop conditions

Stop and reboot if:

- the device disconnects during KASLR capture or exploit execution;
- the runner reports a changed boot identity;
- the payload hash differs after transfer;
- the same-PFN reclaim gate is not verified;
- CPU 7 is unavailable to the runner or cannot be selected;
- the root proof is incomplete;
- SELinux or the shell boundary differs from the expected pre-run state.

Do not turn a failed-closed check into a manual command sequence.
